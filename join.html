Harvey’s values.
We put the needs of others above our own

We realize that customer service is so much more than providing a product to a guest - it’s exceeding expectations by delivering exceptionally selfless service.  We don’t just place the needs of our guests before ourselves, we also put the needs of our team members in front of our own.

We build and educate leaders

We want our team to continually develop and have a clear path of progression.  Even if your stay with us is not long-term, we want to make sure that you’re better prepared for what's ahead after the time that you stayed with us.  Let us invest in you while you’re with us.

We respond to correction with humility

We want team members who are willing to grow and learn.  When we receive criticism, we understand that it’s given to help make us better.

We work hard while having fun

This is what the best careers entail - working hard for a greater goal all the while having the time of our life.  This is what we strive for as a team.
